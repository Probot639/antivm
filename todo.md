# TODOs
- KVMKVMKVM hypervisor bits
- RDTSC forcing VM exit
- Hypervisor bit is on
- Known hypervisor vendor in CPUID
- System uptime with getTickCount()
- CPU Brand
- Reg Key HKLM\HARDWARE\Description\System "SystemBiosVersion"
  - "Bochs" was traced here- check wtf this means

## Hypotheticals
- KVM patch to bypass RDTSC
- guestfish to go into the disk image and fuck with device names
- yet to discover how to deal with hypervisor bits and KVMKVMKVM
